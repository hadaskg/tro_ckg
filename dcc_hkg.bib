%Abstract: In this paper we solve the general problem of designing a feedback
%controller to reach a set of facets of an n-dimensional simplex in finite time, for a
%system evolving with linear affine dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions are
%presented in the form of bilinear inequalities on the vertices of the simplex. By
%exploiting the structure of the problem, the bilinear inequalities are converted to a
%series of linear programming problems.  Keywords: Hybrid systems; Reachability;
%Simplex; Piecewise-linear affine system
